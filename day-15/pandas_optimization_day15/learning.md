## 🛠️ Technologies & Techniques Mastered:

### 1. Memory Optimization
```python
# Data type optimization
int64 → int8/int16/int32 (87.5% memory savings)
object → category (massive string savings)
float64 → float32 (50% memory savings)
```

### 2. Vectorization Mastery
```python
# 248x speed improvement
# Loop: 0.4370 seconds → Vectorized: 0.0018 seconds
df['result'] = df['col1'] + df['col2']  # Always use this!
```

### 3. Chunked Processing
```python
# Process unlimited data sizes
for chunk in pd.read_csv('file.csv', chunksize=1000):
    # Process chunk efficiently
    optimized_chunk = optimize_dtypes(chunk)
```

### 4. Advanced Querying
```python
# Lightning-fast filtering
result = df.query('Income > 50000 and age > 30')
df.eval('new_col = col1 + col2 * col3')
```

### 5. Performance Profiling
```python
# Production monitoring
@profiler.profile_operation("Analysis")
def analyze_data(df):
    return df.groupby('category').agg({'value': 'mean'})
```
