- **Configuration**: 2GB memory, 2 cores per worker

### Docker Configuration
```yaml
services:
  spark-master:
    image: bitnami/spark:3.4
    ports: ["8080:8080", "7077:7077"]
  spark-worker:
    image: bitnami/spark:3.4
    environment:
      SPARK_MASTER_URL: spark://spark-master:7077
```

## üß™ Experiments Conducted

### 1. Partitioning Performance Analysis

**Results:**
- 1 partition: 0.204s (baseline)
- 2 partitions: 0.063s (3.2x improvement)
- 4 partitions: 0.033s (6.2x improvement) ‚≠ê **Optimal**
- 8 partitions: 0.035s (overhead starts)
- 16 partitions: 0.076s (too much overhead)

**Key Insight:** Found sweet spot at 4 partitions for 10K records

### 2. Data Skew Impact

**Scenario:** 80% of data in one partition vs balanced distribution
- **Balanced data:** 0.033s
- **Skewed data:** 0.063s (1.9x slower)

**Learning:** Load balancing is critical for performance
