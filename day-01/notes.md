# Day 1: Understanding Data Engineering
## Key Learnings
- Data engineers build and maintain data pipelines
- ETL/ELT processes are core to data engineering
- Cloud platforms are essential in modern data engineering
- Python and SQL are fundamental skills
## Important Concepts
- **Data Pipeline**: Automated flow of data from source to destination
- **ETL**: Extract, Transform, Load - traditional approach
- **ELT**: Extract, Load, Transform - modern cloud approach
- **Data Lake**: Storage for raw data in various formats
- **Data Warehouse**: Structured storage optimized for analytics
## Questions for Tomorrow
- How do I choose between ETL and ELT?
- What makes a good data pipeline?
- Which cloud platform should I focus on first?
